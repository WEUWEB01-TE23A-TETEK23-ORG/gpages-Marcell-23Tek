            <p class="bildtext">I hike to clear my mind, reconnect with nature, and question every life choice after the first steep incline. There a final kind of peace that comes from standing on a mountaintop. I often feel the need to escape from citys degenercy, to renew my spirit, sit and think for a while without all the background noise.</p>

        <h2>Chopper</h1>

            <img src="./bilder/markus-spiske-ndJLROybri0-unsplash.jpg" alt="Chopper">
            <p class="bildtext">There’s nothing quite like the feeling of riding a chopper. The wind in your face, bugs in your teeth, and the faint scent of engine oil clinging to your soul. I learned early that building your own bike means you’ll spend 90% of your time “tuning” (crying) and 10% actually riding. But when that engine finally roars to life, it’s pure poetry… very loud, slightly smoky poetry.</p>

        <h2>Punk</h1>
        <div class="box">
            
            <img src="./bilder/mauro-romero-JIbkM_hok8Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Punk">
            <p class="bildtext">Punk isn’t just music it’s a lifestyle, a haircut, and sometimes a court summons. I fell in love with punk for its simplicity: three chords, endless energy, and lyrics that sound like they were written in the back of detention (because they probably were). My neighbors call it noise; I call it art. Whether I’m moshing in the living room or arguing about which band “sold out first,” punk keeps me honest, loud, and slightly bruised.</p>
